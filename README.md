A web service for finding homes and volunteer assistance for animals in need. My thesis project.

The idea emerged to create a similar service, so that as many people interested in helping animals as possible could easily and quickly realize their potential. And also to help people find a friend for themselves or for other caring individuals. Additionally, people can obtain information about shelters and consult with a veterinarian online.
